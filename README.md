# NO-HOLIDAY-CUT
It's a project aiming at stopping any holiday cut in Chinese high schools to maintain the rights of teachers and students.

Welcome to the project called NO HOLIDAY CUT.
As the description says, Chinese high schools have suffered from many holiday cuts. Many high schools like Hengshui No.2 high school are likely to regard holiday which should be taken for granted as dirt.
The rights of teachers & students as well as the immortal dignity of teachers are definitely violated.

This project is aiming at eradicating all the holiday cuts in Chinese high schools. The rights for people to rest is included in the laws and various of regulations of P.R.China.
Please add the names of the high school that illegally cut the statutory/summer/winter holidays in the 'SCHOOL-LIST' file to support the holiday rights campaign.

这是一个致力于结束中国高中假期削减、保护师生权利和师道尊严的项目。

欢迎来到“无削减假期”项目。
正如简介所说，中国高中已经出现了严重的假期削减状况。许多高中例如衡水二中正在视师生理所应当享有的假期如粪土。
然而，师生权利和师道尊严正在被侵犯。

这个项目致力于根除中国高中一切假期削减。人民休息的权利是被中华人民共和国的法律和大量的规定所保护的。
如果学校削减了假期（包括寒暑假和法定节假日）并且你支持假期权利运动，请把削减假期的学校的名字添加到“SCHOOL-LIST”文件中。
